Tweet banana-themed inspirational quotes

## Try it yourself!

### Set up the following:
* Python 3 (2 could work, try at your own risk)
* Natural Language ToolKit (https://www.nltk.org/install.html)
* Tweepy (https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy)
* Find some quotes. I used Database Quotes JSON (https://github.com/4skinSkywalker/Database-Quotes-JSON)

### Clone this repository
As is, the code requires a quotes JSON file and Twitter credentials to work. To get your own credentials you'll have to register your twitter app at https://apps.twitter.com/ then authenticate your app (http://docs.tweepy.org/en/v3.6.0/auth_tutorial.html)
